{"name":"Foosballproject","tagline":"AdvancedPogramming Course","body":"### FoosBall\r\nThis project is a FoosBall game implemented using Java wherein we used Swing API, most of the OOPS concepts and patterns. It was a group project done in a team of 4.\r\n\r\n### Technologies and Concepts Used\r\nWe used Swing API which is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. Swing uses AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit), the more traditional way of creating an operating system window to create GUI features. We used SVN to collaborate. \r\n\r\n### Code Structure\r\nThe game has multiple threads running. Each team has a thread of it's own. Along with that wee have a thread for the Ball logic. One thread is dedicated to render the GUI.\r\n\r\n### UML Diagram\r\n![](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6UMYaYdbds6fmxOdjRTRHBZWjc0dm1fbjJhR3hzNW4yMlR5Yi0yUHkwenVrMGxYbGVQQmc)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
